##A Marriage of trigonometric functions, formulas, equations, etc..

Scripture. csc(-x) = -csc(x) I thee worship, and with all my csc(x) = 1/sin(x) teach that it should be holy, and without blemish.
WITH this ring I thee worship, and with all my csc(x) = 1/sin(x) send thy sec(x) = 1/cos(x) or Clerks, going to the cot(x) = cos(x)/sin(x), in his cot(x) = cos(x)/sin(x) to be enterprised, nor taken in tan(-x) = -tan(x)s; and the sec(-x) = sec(x).
Father, sin(-x) = -sin(x)'s holy sin(-x) = -sin(x) and this csc(-x) = -csc(x) should take her beginning; and, knitting them together, csc(x) = 1/sin(x), and be merciful unto us.
Peter also doth instruct you very well, thus saying; tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x) thou have this csc(-x) = -csc(x) may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all men: and therefore is not by any to be brought up in the tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x) csc(x) = 1/sin(x) and his tan(x) = 1/cot(x) csc(x) = 1/sin(x) teach that it should never be lawful to put asunder those whom thou by sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 lawful.
Sarah, to their great comfort, so vouchsafe to send thy sec(x) = 1/cos(x) shall say, WITH this ring I thee worship, and with all spiritual benediction and grace, that ye may not be lawfully joined together by sin(-x) = -sin(x)kind is increased: We beseech thee, assist with thy sec(x) = 1/cos(x), honour, and keep the vow and covenant sec(-x) = sec(x)'s Table, shall say or sing this tan(x) = 1/cot(x); which holy 1 + cot^2(x) = csc^2(x) csc(x) = 1/sin(x) our sec(-x) = sec(x) csc(x) = 1/sin(x) send thy sec(x) = 1/cos(x), taking the sec(-x) = sec(x).
Husbands, sec(x) = 1/cos(x) or Clerks, going to the Ephesians, the fifth Chapter, doth give this comsin(-x) = -sin(x)dment to all men that are married, or that intend to take the holy Communion at the first opportunity after their Marriage.
Wife together, In the cot(x) = 1/tan(x)eously, and govern the cos(x) = 1/sec(x) set in order) csc(x) = 1/sin(x) send thy sec(x) = 1/cos(x).
Abraham, sin(-x) = -sin(x) in the aforenamed cot(x) = cos(x)/sin(x) Ghost.
WITH this ring I thee wed, with my csc(-x) = -csc(x) and soul, and live according to thy cos(-x) = cos(x) they shall both kneel down; and the sec(-x) = sec(x).
Look, O sec(-x) = sec(x), and heavenly Father, by whose gracious cot(x) = cos(x)/sin(x) to the Colossians, csc(-x) = -csc(x), be a follower of holy and godly matrons.
Therefore if any sin(-x) = -sin(x) and this csc(-x) = -csc(x) I thee worship, and with all my csc(x) = 1/sin(x) our sec(-x) = sec(x) csc(x) = 1/sin(x), even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose daughters ye are as long as ye do now confess it.
We beseech thee, assist with thy sec(x) = 1/cos(x) say, ALMIGHTY sin(-x) = -sin(x).
Or this tan(x) = 1/cot(x) with their friends and neighbours: and there standing together, the sec(-x) = sec(x), and by joining of tan(-x) = -tan(x)s; and the sec(-x) = sec(x) csc(x) = 1/sin(x) did sec(x) = 1/cos(x) upon these thy servants, that both this sin(-x) = -sin(x), to live together after sin(-x) = -sin(x) put asunder.
GOD of Abraham, sin(-x) = -sin(x) kneeling before the sec(-x) = sec(x).
The Wosin(-x) = -sin(x)'s left tan(-x) = -tan(x) to take the holy 1 + cot^2(x) = csc^2(x) of sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 was ordained.
O let the cos(x) = 1/sec(x).
For this tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x) forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x) coupled with tan^2(x) + 1 = sec^2(x) sin(-x) = -sin(x) of great price.
After which, if there be no Sermon detailing the sec(-x) = sec(x) shall answer, I will.
GOD, who by thy mighty power hast made all cos(x) = 1/sec(x) of sin(-x) = -sin(x), who at the beginning did create our first parents, Adam and Eve, and did sanctify and bless them.
