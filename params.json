{"name":"Infinite Epithalamium","tagline":"A NaNoGenMo project in honor of my upcoming wedding","body":"I'm getting married in March. Since neither me nor my partner are religious, we're writing our own ceremony from scratch. I thought I'd use this project to generate a wedding ceremony.\r\n\r\nIn 1595, Edmund Spenser wrote the _Epithalamion_ in honor of his second marriage. The poem claims to work as a kind of talisman, ensuring a good marriage will follow. I'm not a poet, and I can't claim to exert any kind of magical power with the force of my words or my code. What I can do is nod at the infinite variety of relationships, generate a few nonsensical jokes, and prepare to make an eternal vow.\r\n\r\n_Infinite Epithalamium_, my NaNoGenMo project, uses noun-replacement and Markov chains to generate wedding ceremonies for random lists of nouns. (For more information, check out the [project repo](https://github.com/jrladd/nanogenmo-2015) \r\n\r\nI realize this is a weird way for me to express my joy about getting married (and of course, none of these new texts can become our actual ceremony), but I'm pleased with the way this turned out. I can't always find the words to express how I feel about this person I've chosen to spend my life with, so it's comforting to know there are infinite combinations of words out there. So without further ado:\r\n\r\n#Infinite Epithalamium\r\n\r\n##A Marriage of musical genres taken from wikipedia article titles.\r\n\r\nBreakcore.
